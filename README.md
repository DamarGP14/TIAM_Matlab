# TIAM_Matlab

This code was written in the context of the elaboration of a master's thesis at the UPV/EHU. 

It contains the MatLab code used to solve both the Single Impurity and the Two-Impurity Anderson Model. The Slave-boson Pseudo-particle method is used, see the thesis for details.

The usage is simple:

1) Open the main file SIAM_solver or TIAM_solver.
2) Choose the parameters you want for your model, they are at the begining of the code. If you wish to do a sweep of values, you will have to set up a loop.
3) Press the Run button and stare at the waitingbar for a few minutes.
4) Wow! A plot with the DOS appears in your screen. Congrats!!

For any doubts, bugs, suggestions...
